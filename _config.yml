  desc: I am a PhD graduate student at the University of New Hampshire and Research Assistant at the Hubbard Center for Genome Studies. I spend most of my days doing bioinformatics - writing code to analyze next-generation sequencing data. My current work has been focused on improving metagenomic analyses of benthic metazoa by vastly expanding the set of meiofaunal genome references. As of today, I am writing scripts to analyze mitochondrial metagenomic data. Outside of work I enjoy traveling, I'll be heading to a camping trip to Yellowstone in July. Check out my blog. # Describe yourself.
